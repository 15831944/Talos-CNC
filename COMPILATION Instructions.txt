All code is still currently CPU agnostic. Some work is still needed in the HAL
to fully impliment the 32 bit ARM hardware.
1. Open the "Talos_c++ All" solution in Atmel studio
2. If you are building for an AVR (2560,328P,etc..)
	a. Right click the "Talos_c++_AVR" project
	b. Click on "Clean Solution" to clear all prebuilt .obj files
	c. Right click the "Talos_c++_AVR" project again, and click "Build"
3. If you are building for an ARM/SAM (SAM3X8E,SAM3X8A,etc..)
	a. Right click the "Talos_c++_SAM" project
	b. Click on "Clean Solution" to clear all prebuilt .obj files
	c. Right click the "Talos_c++_SAM" project again, and click "Build"

The solution is just a convenient way to group the projects and code together.
There are no differences in the code. It is all the same, in the same fodlers.
When the HAL is updated with all the SAM processor changes I will upload it
and anyone should be able to build for either platform in one convenient place.

Note:The code has grown beyond the limits of the smaller 328P. I may create a 
lightweight version of this for the 328, but there is no way to get the full
feature set on the 328 now. The code excedes the memory capcaity by 233%.

The old AVR only Talos_c++ project has been removed.
