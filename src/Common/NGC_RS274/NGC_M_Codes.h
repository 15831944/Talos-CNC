All codes defined in here are multiplied by G_CODE_MULTIPLIER so they can be handled as ints or char's
Double and float tyeps consume too much memory to have a numberic variable with only one
decimal place. It is jsut not worth it.
Any value that would be below 256 after multiplication is a char. any value over 256 is an int
