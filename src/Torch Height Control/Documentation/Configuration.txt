This torch height controller is programmable. This means that you do not have to make code changes and compile a new binary file to upload to the controller.
You may specify the port and pin of your choosing to read limit switches and touch off on your work piece. 

If you are using an arduino or similar clone, you can readily find the 'port' that applies to a particular arduino pin o the internet.
Programming is simple:
Specify # as the first byte of the serial message. This tellers the THC you are configuring something
Specify the mode of the configuration (I or O). I = Input, O = Output. Mode must be followed by a comma (,)
Specify the THC function that goes with this configuration. (For list of functions look in Fcuntions.txt). Function must be followed by a comma (,)
Specify the port on the board that will be input or output. Port must be followed by a comma (,)
Specify the pin that the input or output will act on. Pin must be followed by a comma (,)

To set the port and pin for a limit switch INPUT simply type:
#I,lower_limit_switch,0x000,1
This configures port 0x000 as input, assigns pin value 1 to it, and connects it to the lower_limit_switch function. If you wish to mvoe the limit switch to 
a different pin, simply re-assign the pin.
