				we need a way to flag that block to not execute motion yet. The feed mode must be
				configured first.
				
				Arc and line motions are ultimately processed the same way. Lines go to the line
				processor, arcs first go to the arc calculator then to the line processor

				We can't or shouldnt process the segment buffer on a block thats being held up for 
				any reason.

				To determine absolute distance we must know where the machine was at AFTER the last 
				block was processed. If no block has been processed yet, then we must assume the
				home position

				Spindle control COULD be handled in the motion control, but it should be constructed
				in a fashion that allows it be be controlled by another processor because ultimately
				that will probably be the best scenario.
