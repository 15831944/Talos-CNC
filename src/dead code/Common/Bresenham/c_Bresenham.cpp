/*
During interpolation, a stepper motor can lose a step. When that occurs the end user may not be aware of it.
If feedback is used, and its configured for closed loop, this algorithm will 'predict' where the subordinate
axis positions should be based on a factor of difference in the target end points. If the predicted lead
calculation results in a value that does not match the current position, then the interpolation is not in
synchronization. This will alert the user to that condition, and may cause the motion to stop. What happens
when an axis fault is detected is up to the user and how they want to handle such a condition. Generally
this condition will cause a hard stop of the machine and it will need to be powered down and reset to home.
NOTE:This will only work properly with a linear motion, not an arc. calculate_arc is specifically for arcs.
*/

/*
'current' should be an array of int32_t type with MACHINE_AXIS_COUNT elements in it. The values of current
would ideally be values from encoders or resolvers indicating the position of each axis in steps or ticks.
If using encoders with a CPR rate different than the steppers motion rate (800 steps per rev steppers/drivers
and 100 pulse per rev encoders) you cannot work directly off of the tick count. The pulse and encoder tick
counts must be converted to a distance first. If simple positional feedback is all that is desired, this can
be considered a loop back and will always match the position of the Bresenham steps.
